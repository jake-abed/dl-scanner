# Driver's License Scanner

This web app allows a user to quickly scan the barcode on the back of their US driver's license and extract data from it. This can be tricky if the user webcam/camera is low enough quality. After enough failed attempts, the application will prompt the user to simply enter their information manually or upload a photo from a better device.

## To-Do

-   Polish UI/UX
-   Build out tests.
